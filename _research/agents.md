# AI Employee Agents for GKE Hackathon

## üîå A2A Protocol Integration

The Agent-to-Agent (A2A) protocol enables our agents to collaborate across platform boundaries without direct API access. Instead of boutique agents calling bank APIs (impossible due to security), agents request services from each other through standardized A2A messages.

### How It Works
- Each agent advertises capabilities via an **Agent Card**
- Agents discover what other agents can do
- Agents request services through A2A messages
- Responses provide insights, not raw data
- All communications are logged for audit

### Key Benefits
- **Security**: Bank data stays with bank agents
- **Privacy**: Agents share insights, not customer data  
- **Flexibility**: New agents integrate without API changes
- **Natural**: Agents communicate in task-oriented messages

### Technology Stack
- **Container Runtime:** Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)
- **AI Model:** Google Gemini
- **Agent Communication:** A2A (Agent-to-Agent) protocol for all inter-agent messages
- **Service Communication:** gRPC for microservice calls, REST for Bank APIs
- **State Management:** Separate Redis/PostgreSQL for agent-specific data
- **Observability:** OpenTelemetry integration with existing services

### Key Design Principles
1. **No Core Modification:** Agents only consume existing APIs
2. **Stateless Operations:** Agents maintain their own state separately
3. **Fault Tolerance:** Graceful degradation if services unavailable
4. **Scalability:** Each agent can scale independently on GKE
5. **Security:** JWT tokens for service authentication, following existing patterns
